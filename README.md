# a11y-tokyo-soundboard

A soundboard for the a11y tokyo meetup

Features:
- press any of the buttons to play one of 5 announcements to go home
- button 5 is assigned to a song playing at 5 pm in the Greater Tokyo area (see Note)
- buttons 7 to 9 play a laughter
- pressing the number buttons 1 to 9 in the number row of a keyboard will trigger each sound

There are some ideas to improve still, 

Note: the version of [夕焼け小焼け originates from youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02-ZA7Mw3j4), not sure what this will do to the license...
 【有線放送チャイム】大阪府堺市東区日置荘原寺町17時　新音源「夕焼け小焼け」 is what was used.
